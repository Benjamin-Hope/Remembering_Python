# python has a lot of library modules which can be imported to do many things

# lets start with the math module importation:

import math  # this imports the math module
# documentation about these modules can be found online
# we can access the functions inside the math module by:

sqrt = math.sqrt(25)  # this returns the square root of 25

print(sqrt)
